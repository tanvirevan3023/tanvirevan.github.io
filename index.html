                  <p> I have learned so much in my classes with (TN). She/He paces the class just right so you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. So many other classes you just read from a text book but in his classes (TN) asks questions and gets the students to respond which is both fun and promotes faster learning. She/He is patient and eager to help. I’m thrilled to have found her/his class!</p>
